# Sankaku Complex Image Downloader

## What is it?

This python script downloads all the images in a Sankaku Complex Post for you.

### What is Sankaku Complex?

[Sankaku Complex](https://www.sankakucomplex.com/) __(+18)__ is a blog-website with anime, manga and game related content.
Most post contains image that if you're a anime fan, you probably want to download.
So why not automate this process instead of saving manually every image in the post?

### Example

All the images contained in the red lined `div` (wich `id="postcontent"`) are going to be save on a new directory.
